# Using TSN-enabled Network Hardware

The hardware card must be carefully selected to enable full hardware
offloading on Linux. The Intel I210
([spec](https://cdrdv2-public.intel.com/333016/333016%20-%20I210_Datasheet_v_3_7.pdf))
is recommended in our settings.

## Verifying the Network Card

The network device must have at least 2 or more builtin hardware
queues builtin. To verify it,
```sh
ethtool -l eth0
```

It shows that Intel I210 has at least 4 channels.

```
Channel parameters for eth0
Pre-set maximums:
RX:		0
TX:		0
Other:		1
Combined:	4
Current hardware settings:
RX:		0
TX:		0
Other:		1
Combined:	4
```

The second is the check whether the card suppots full hardware
offloading.  To verify it, create a TAPRIO policy on the device with
`flag 0x1`.  It should run without erros.

```sh
sudo tc qdisc replace dev eth0 parent root handle 100 taprio \
                     num_tc 3 \
                     map 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \
                     queues 1@0 1@0 1@0 \
                     base-time 1528743495910289987 \
                     sched-entry S 01 300000 \
                     sched-entry S 02 300000 \
                     sched-entry S 04 400000 \
                     flags 0x1 \
                     txtime-delay 200000 \
                     clockid CLOCK_TAI 
```


## Troubleshooting

### Cannot detect interface

- The port used for the experiment cannot be detected. It is likely a hardware issue.
- After we removed the network card and switched it to another slot, then reconfigured the IP and VLAN settings.

Unable to ping the other VLAN.
Shortly after booting up, unable to ping even the physical interfaces.
Checked the routes:

```
192.168.1.0/24 dev vlan1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.2 metric 400 linkdown 
192.168.7.0/24 dev enP4p4s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.7.2 metric 102 linkdown
```

Display as "linkdown," manually bringing them up (using ip link set up) had no effect.
Physical interface status displayed as:

```
<NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> 
```

Attempts such as reconfiguring IP settings and restarting via nmtui were unsuccessful.
The issue was ultimately resolved by changing the network card to a different slot.
